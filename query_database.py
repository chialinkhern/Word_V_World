"""
WARNING:
A database is not like a dictionary.
A dictionary has a unique key and a value associated with that key.
A database on the other hand, simply consists of rows.
This means there can be multiple rows, each with the same content. 
That is okay. 
In our case, this means that the word-pair co-occurred the same number of times in one bodies.txt file
as it does in another bodies.txt file.
This must be considered when querying a single word-pair,
 because in many cases multiple rows exist for the same word-pair.
